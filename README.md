# HOUSE-PROCE-PREDICTION
A Linear Regression model was built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms. The dataset was preprocessed, categorical variables were encoded, and the model was trained. Performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy.
